In this project, we'll explore data collected by a team of Polish economists studying bankruptcy. Our goal is to build a model that can predict whether a company will go bankrupt or not.

Once you complete these project, we'll be able to:

1.Navigate a file system from the Linux command line
2.Load and save files using Python
3.Address imbalanced data using resampling techniques
4.Evaluate a model using classification metrics like precision and recall
